# my-playground

PURPOSE:
Do you have a favorite singing friend in Smule? Well, I do! And I have been wondering how many songs in total we have sung together! Never would have thought that my first project outside my coding bootcamp would be for this -and it's already worth all the sweat & tears of going through the bootcamp!

Note: I am sure many hard-core programmers already figured this out, but I created this as a 3-month-old programming toddler; hence, the OMG-excitement :D

This entire project is dedicated to getting a list of songs that you sang with your favorite person in the app since the age of time (C'on.. it can't just be me that is obsessed with this curiosity!)

Instructions:
- Download the whole content in the Resources folder.
- Add the username in the config.py file
- Run the code in the jupyter notebook
  > Note all the library that you should have before you run the code.
