PURPOSE:
Do you have a favorite singing friend(s) in Smule? Well... I do! Smule doesn't have a good way to show you list of songs you sang, and I have been wondering how many songs in total I have sung together with my favorite person/people!  Never would have thought that my first project outside my coding bootcamp would be for this -and it's already worth all the sweat & tears of going through the bootcamp!

This entire project is dedicated to getting a list of songs that you sang with your favorite person in the app since the age of time (C'on.. it can't just be me that is obsessed with this curiosityğŸ™„)

Because there's a limit on the request you can make, you will not have access to Smule web for ..I think it's 24 hrs (?).. So, please be warned!

Instructions:
- Download the whole content in the Resources folder.
- Add the username in the config.py file
- Run the code in the jupyter notebook
  > Note all the library that you should have before you run the code.
 - IF after you run the first loop and you get an error in the 2nd loop, just save the csv of the first loop and rerun the notebook the next day. The two csv can be merged at the end.
  > Yeah, haven't figured out any way around that yetğŸ˜… And Smule doesn't spawn a way to do API requestğŸ˜«
- Done!

Note: I am sure many hard-core programmers already figured this out, but I created this as a 3-month-old programming toddler; hence, the OMG-excitementğŸ¤©
